# CrimeSample---R-Project-

In this project I did the following using the crimesample csv:

1. Removed the missing values
2. Checked for duplicates
3. Rounded the numbers
4. Check for outliers using boxplots
5. Biovariate analysis
6. Checked the correlation between data

All of these tasks were done on R.
